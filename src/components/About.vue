        <p>In the past we've raised over enough money to give over <b>six full one-year scholarships</b> to students in developing countries through UMR, in addition to support building a distribution system in Maventibao, Madagascar that makes water more accessible for the people who live there. Engineers in our organization are <b>big on philanthropy</b> and we pick the projects that prove it.</p>
